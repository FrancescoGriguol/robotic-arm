# Robotic Arm Modeling and Control in Simulink

This repository presents a comprehensive model of a robotic manipulator and its control system developed in the Simulink environment. The project focuses on implementing both the forward and inverse kinematics of the manipulator, defining desired trajectories, and simulating its kinematic and dynamic behavior.

Key features include:

- **Forward and Inverse Kinematics:** Analytical computation of the manipulator's pose and joint angles.
- **Trajectory Planning:** Definition of joint space trajectories for task execution.
- **Dynamic Simulation:** Modeling of manipulator dynamics, including actuator systems.
- **Control System:** Implementation of a joint-space feedback controller to ensure accurate trajectory tracking.
- **Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC):** Integration of kinematics and control strategies to achieve precise manipulator motion.

All simulations and control schemes are realized within the joint space control framework, enabling robust and efficient manipulation.
